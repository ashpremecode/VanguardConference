# Vanguard Conference Website

http://www.vanguardconference.com.au/

A website for a conference that my church is hosting on the 19-21 September 2019.

Vanguard Conference is a three nights conference focused on equipping and empowering young adults to be influential, forward thinking and ground breaking in their life and their spheres. Hosted by Elevation Hills Young Adult.

### Motivation
It is the first time we are hosting a conference for the young adults community in the Hills area. We wanted to have an online presence and a website to have information on what the conference is all about.
